## Where is Keir Starmer's an electoral asset to Labour?

The file [starmer_likeability_mrp_lme4.R](https://github.com/hymeram/mrp/blob/main/starmer_likeability_mrp/starmer_likeability_mrp_lme4.R) is the script for a implementation of MRP using the lme4 library for classical mixed models. For computational reasons I opted for lme4 over a Bayesian implementation of MRP. The literature generally prefers Bayesian multilevel modelling for MRP due to its superiority at estimating random effects with a small number of categories and its ability to better estimate the uncertainty of estimates. From my own comparisons, the estimates of lme4 and rstanarm (a library implementing Bayesian models) generate similar MRP estimates - I intend to add a more in-depth comparison of classical and Bayesian MRP to this repository.
