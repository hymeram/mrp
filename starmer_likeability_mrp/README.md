## Where is Keir Starmer's an electoral asset to Labour?

The file [starmer_likeability_mrp_lme4.R](https://github.com/hymeram/mrp/blob/main/starmer_likeability_mrp/starmer_likeability_mrp_lme4.R) is the script for a implementation of MRP using the lme4 library for classical mixed models. For computational reasons I opted for lme4 over a Bayesian implementation of MRP which the literature generally prefers due to its superiority at estimating random effects with a small number of categories and its ability to better estimate the uncertainty of estimates.
