## Estimating voting intention at a constituency level using MRP

The file is the script for a implementation of the MRP using the lme4 library for classical mixed models. For computational reasons I opted for lme4 over a Bayesian implementation of MRP.

The post-stratification frame was created by Professor Chris Hanretty and is available here: <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/1478929919864773/suppl_file/hlv_psw.csv>.

The hexmap was created by the [House of Commons Library](https://github.com/houseofcommonslibrary/uk-hex-cartograms-noncontiguous)
